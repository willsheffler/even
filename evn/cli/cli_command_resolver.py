cli_command_resolver.py

This module provides utilities for inspecting and resolving Click commands within
the EVeN CLI metaclass system. It enables discovery of all registered commands,
resolution by dotted path, and traversal of CLI hierarchies.

Functions:
- walk_commands(root): Recursively yield all (path, command) pairs from a CLI root.
- find_command(root, path): Resolve a command from a dotted path string.
- get_all_cli_paths(): List all command paths from all registered CLI classes.

Example:

>>> from evn.cli import CLI
>>> class Top(CLI):
...     def greet(self): pass
>>> from evn.cli.cli_command_resolver import walk_commands
>>> commands = list(walk_commands(Top))
>>> assert any(p == 'top.greet' for p, _ in commands)
